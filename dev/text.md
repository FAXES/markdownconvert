As Phil Bot is a Node.Js operating website it requires a little more power than you might be used to with a more common site. This article covers some more specific details on what you need to run Phil Bot.


> All of Phil Bots documentation is created for Ubuntu 20 based Linux servers. Currently we don't offer any Windows guides. It's highly recommended to use a Ubuntu 20 based Linux server for hosting Phil Bot.


### What do you need?

To have the ability to have Phil Bot running using our installation guide it's recommended to use the following.

- Server (This can be a VPS or Dedicated machine, Ubuntu is recommended)
- A domain name (`projectphil.co.uk` for example). This is used to get your website to the online world via a public access domain
- PayPal business or Stripe account to be able to receive any payments.
- Discord account to use for Login methods.

#### System Requirements

These are the minimum and recommended requirements for your system to have to host Phil Bot.

FaxStore is a Node.Js based website and requires a server (VPS, Dedicated) to operate. Shared hosting doesn't work
:::

As FaxStore is a Node.Js operating website it requires a little more power than you might be used to with a more common site. This article covers some more specific details on what you need to run FaxStore.


> All of FaxStores documentation is created for Ubuntu 20 based Linux servers. Currently we don't offer any Windows guides. It's highly recommended to use a Ubuntu 20 based Linux server for hosting FaxStore.


### What do you need?

To have the ability to have FaxStore running using our installation guide it's recommended to use the following.

- Server (This can be a VPS or Dedicated machine, Ubuntu is recommended)
- A domain name (`faxes.zone` for example). This is used to get your website to the online world via a public access domain
- PayPal business or Stripe account to be able to receive any payments.
- Discord, Google, Twitter, or GitHub account to use for Login methods.

#### System Requirements

These are the minimum and recommended requirements for your system to have to host FaxStore.

| Minimum                                                              | Recommended                                                            |
